# Team Profile Generator

A Node.js command-line application takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

## Description

Project teams often have a website that provides information about their group, and the work they perform.  This tool can be used to build a team profile for display on a corporate intranet or other web service.

This project extends the web-coding knowledge base we are building in our boot camp by incorporating Object Oriented Programming concepts and modularization (multiple files linked with export/require statement pairs).
